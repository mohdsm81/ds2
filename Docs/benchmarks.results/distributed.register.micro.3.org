cutoff = 50K (100K for SR) 
avg of 3 runs

_NOTE:_ we ran IRed for over 203 hrs using the second harness (2r+2w)
for the distributed register benchmark to see how much fewer schedules
LV explores in comparison and it showed no sign of finishing so we had
to kill it.

    *After the harness tweak*
    _disabled_: writeAck, readAck, readReplicaAck
