cutoff = 50K (100K for SR) 
avg of 3 runs

_NOTE:_ we ran IRed for over 203 hrs using the second harness (2r+2w)
for the distributed register benchmark to see how much fewer schedules
LV explores in comparison and it showed no sign of finishing so we had
to kill it.

    _disabled_: writeAck, readAck, readReplicaAck
    _not reliable_: reason is readReplicaAck can interfere with both
    the state and other write-related messaging such as
    writeReplicaAck's.
